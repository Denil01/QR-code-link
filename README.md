### What I learned

```html
<h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
                <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
```

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');
```

## Continued development

I would wish to continue to learn how to differentiate the width difference between mobile phone and desktop.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me learn more about google fonts, and also how to apply it to css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
